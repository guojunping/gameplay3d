## GamePlay v3.0.0

GamePlay is an open-source, cross-platform, C++ game framework/engine for creating 2D/3D mobile and desktop games.

Occasionally discovered the Gameplay3D game engine, the code is relatively simple and easy to understand, it is very helpful for learning and researching the game engine, but does not support Unicode text support, and has not maintained the update for a long time, in order to facilitate future learning and use, in the official last updated version Added unicode text support. Fixed some simple bugs.
I will continue to update and improve the Gameplay3D game engine in the future.
More people are welcome to join.

偶然发现了Gameplay3D游戏引擎,代码比较简单易懂,对于学习研究游戏引擎很有帮助,但不支持Unicode文本支持,而且很久无人维护更新,,为了方便以后学习和使用,在官方最后更新的版本上增加了unicode文本支持。 修复了一些简单bug。 
本人以后持续更新完善Gameplay3D游戏引擎。
欢迎更多人加入。
